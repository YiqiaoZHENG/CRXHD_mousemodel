# CRX homeodomain missense mutations associated with dominant blinding diseases
This respository contains all code and selected processed data necessary to reproduce figures in "" by [Zheng et al.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.87147.1)

## Prerequisites and Data availability
Necessary software packages with versions used to process data are described seperately in sub-directories for different dataset. 
- Specseq data mapping and quantification was performed on [WSL:Ubuntu-20.04](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
- ChIPseq and RNAseq data mapping and quantification was performed on the WashU High Throughput Computing Facility ([HTCF](https://htcf.wustl.edu/docs/)) using [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html).
- Further processing of intermediate data and visualization of processed data was performed on WSL:Ubuntu-20.04.
- Raw data and additional processed data for this manuscript can be downloaded from GEO under SuperSeries [GSE223659](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE223659).

## Repository organization
- `ChIPseq_analysis`, `RNAseq_analysis`, `Specseq_analysis` each contains scripts, metadata text files, and any intermediate data generated under the `processed_data` folder. Detailed descriptions on the usage of these scripts can be found in the README.md under each sub-directory.
- `1.manuscript_figures.ipynb` is used to generate figures and perform statistics with processed data from all three dataset. The notebook follows the figure orders in the manuscript.
- `Figures` contains all main figures and extended data figures for the manuscript generated by the Jupyter notebook `1.manuscript_figures.ipynb`.
- `utils` contains files with Python functions used to process intermediate data and to visualize the processed data.
